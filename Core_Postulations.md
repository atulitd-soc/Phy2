Core Postulations (Regime-Based Interpretation)

1. Measured observables correspond to properties of an entity, not the entity itself.
Physical measurements access specific properties (observables) determined by the interaction and measurement setup. As with water—where temperature, viscosity, or optical density are measured depending on the probe—the underlying entity is not exhausted by any single observable set.


2. An entity may possess intrinsic properties that do not manifest under a given physical environment.
The absence of observation does not imply absence of properties, but may reflect environmental or interaction constraints that suppress their expression.


3. Different environments may permit different subsets of properties to manifest.
Properties that are inaccessible or suppressed in one regime may become dominant and observable in another, without altering the intrinsic identity of the entity.


4. The expression of properties may be cyclic or phase-dependent.
Analogous to electromagnetic waves—where electric and magnetic components alternate in dominance—different intrinsic characteristics of an entity may become observable at different phases or cycles, while the entity itself remains invariant.


5. Non-expressed properties define orthogonal regimes of existence.
Properties that do not couple to interactions in our physical environment constitute effectively orthogonal regimes: coexisting, but non-interacting and therefore unobservable within our regime.


6. Our universe corresponds to one such stable regime of expression.
Physics as currently formulated is internally complete within this regime, but may not exhaust all intrinsic characteristics of underlying entities.



Reinterpretation of Selected Anomalous Phenomena

Within this framework, several well-known conceptual difficulties in physics can be reframed without modifying existing laws:

1. Wave–particle duality
Wave-like and particle-like behaviors are not dual natures of an entity, but different properties expressed under different measurement regimes. The apparent duality reflects regime selection, not ontological contradiction.


2. Black hole singularities
Singular behavior may indicate the breakdown of property expression within our regime, with certain characteristics no longer expressible and effectively transitioning to orthogonal regimes, rather than physical infinities.


3. Quantum entanglement
Nonlocal correlations arise from shared intrinsic structure of entities that is not fully constrained by spacetime locality within a single regime. No superluminal signaling is implied.


4. Dark matter
Dark matter may correspond to entities whose dominant properties do not couple electromagnetically in our regime, yet remain gravitationally coupled due to shared regime-independent characteristics.


5. Dark energy
Dark energy may reflect large-scale changes in regime synchronization or dominance of properties that influence spacetime dynamics without appearing as conventional matter or fields.



Summary Statement

In this view, modern physics accurately describes the behavior of entities as they express properties within our regime of existence, but may be silent about intrinsic characteristics that do not couple to our environment. The framework does not introduce new dynamics or entities; it proposes a reinterpretation of what observables represent, suggesting that several persistent anomalies arise from treating regime-dependent properties as exhaustive descriptions of reality.
