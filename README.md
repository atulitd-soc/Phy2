# A Regime-Based Interpretation of Physical Reality

This repository contains a scientific preprint proposing a **regime-based reinterpretation of physical observables and entities**. The work is interpretive and conceptual in nature and does **not** introduce new particles, forces, or modifications to existing physical laws.

The central idea is that modern physics may be **complete within a given regime of expression**, while not necessarily exhaustive of all intrinsic characteristics of underlying entities. Observable properties are treated as *regime-selected expressions*, rather than exhaustive definitions of physical entities themselves.

The framework is intended to remain fully compatible with established theories in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, relativity, and cosmology, while offering alternative perspectives on unresolved foundational problems.

## Scope and Intent

- This work is **not a new physical theory**.
- It does **not claim mathematical completeness or predictive novelty**.
- It does **not propose new dynamics or violations of known laws**.
- It is a **reinterpretive framework**, intended to:
  - clarify conceptual assumptions,
  - reorganize known phenomena,
  - suggest new questions and directions for formalization or testing.

The contribution lies in a structural distinction between **entities** and the **properties they express under specific interaction regimes**, and in exploring the implications of this distinction for foundational physics.

## Key Concepts (High-Level)

- **Regimes of Expression**  
  Stable sets of constraints under which specific intrinsic characteristics of entities manifest and interact.

- **Regime Completeness vs. Substrate Incompleteness**  
  Physics may be internally complete within a regime, while not exhausting all intrinsic characteristics of underlying entities.

- **Multiplexed Expression**  
  Fundamental entities may express different sets of characteristics across orthogonal regimes, analogous to time-sliced processes sharing the same hardware in a real-time operating system.

- **Compatibility with Existing Physics**  
  All established equations and empirical successes are preserved within their operational domains.

## What This Work Does *Not* Address

- Consciousness, cognition, or observer-dependent ontology
- Metaphysical claims about ultimate reality
- Replacement or unification of existing theories
- Claims of experimental verification

Any such extensions are explicitly considered **out of scope**.

## Status of the Work

This is an **early-stage conceptual framework** shared for the purposes of:

- critical evaluation,
- mathematical formalization by specialists,
- identification of contradictions or redundancies,
- or informed rejection.

Feedback, critique, and independent assessment are explicitly welcomed.
