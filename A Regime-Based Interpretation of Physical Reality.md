A Regime-Based Interpretation of Physical Reality

Abstract

Despite the empirical success of modern physics, persistent foundational tensions remain at the interface of quantum mechanics, relativity, gravity, and cosmology. These include the interpretation of measurement and decoherence, the nature of nonlocal correlations, the absence of a consistent quantum description of gravity, and the unresolved status of dark matter and dark energy. This work proposes a reinterpretive framework based on a distinction between entities and the properties they express under specific interaction regimes. It is suggested that observable physics may be complete within a given regime, yet not exhaustive of all intrinsic characteristics of underlying entities. Without introducing new particles, forces, or modifications to established equations, the framework remains fully compatible with existing physical laws while offering alternative perspectives on several outstanding conceptual problems. The aim is not to provide closure, but to articulate a structural distinction that may guide further formalization, testing, or refutation.

1. Motivation

Modern physical theories exhibit extraordinary predictive accuracy within their operational domains. Quantum field theory, general relativity, and the Standard Model together describe observed phenomena with remarkable precision. Nevertheless, several conceptual and structural issues remain unresolved, including:

-the lack of a consistent quantum description of gravity,

-ambiguity surrounding wave–particle duality and measurement,

-the interpretation of decoherence and the emergence of classicality,

-apparent nonlocality in entanglement,

-gravitational phenomena attributed to dark matter and dark energy,

-and the nature of cosmological initial conditions.

These difficulties suggest not necessarily incorrect equations, but the possibility that what our equations describe has been misidentified or incompletely characterized.

This work explores the hypothesis that current physics may be regime-complete rather than substrate-complete.

2. Core Distinction: Entity vs. Expressed Properties

We begin with a minimal but critical distinction:

An entity is not identical to the set of properties it expresses under a given observational or interaction context.

Physical theories necessarily operate on observables. However, observable properties need not exhaust the intrinsic constitution of an entity. Measurement, interaction, and environment may select which intrinsic characteristics become dominant and observable, without creating or destroying those characteristics.

This distinction is already implicit in quantum mechanics. Wave–particle duality, contextuality, and environment-dependent behavior indicate that observed properties depend on interaction configuration rather than intrinsic contradiction.

3. Regimes of Expression

We define a regime as a stable set of constraints under which particular intrinsic characteristics of entities can manifest and interact.

Under this framework:

-A universe corresponds to a stable regime of expression.

-Each regime supports internally consistent physics.

-Other regimes may coexist simultaneously.

-Regimes are orthogonal if their dominant characteristics do not couple.

Orthogonality here is not necessarily spatial or geometric. It refers to non-interaction of dominant degrees of freedom.

Observers embedded within a regime naturally infer continuity, locality, and exclusivity, since only regime-permitted expressions are accessible.

4. Multiplexing Analogy

An instructive analogy is provided by real-time operating systems. Multiple processes execute on the same hardware via time-slicing and multiplexing. Each process experiences itself as continuous and exclusive, while remaining unaware of other processes unless explicit interfaces exist.

Analogously, fundamental entities may be multiplexed across multiple regimes, expressing different sets of intrinsic characteristics in each. Physics describes the behavior of entities as expressed within a given regime, not the full intrinsic structure.

In this sense, physics may be slice-complete but not substrate-complete.

5. Compatibility with Established Physics

This framework does not introduce new particles, forces, or modifications to known equations. All established laws remain valid within their operational domains.

5.1 Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory

Fields may be interpreted as media of expression. Measurement selects dominant characteristics rather than collapsing ontological states. Decoherence corresponds to environment-dependent suppression of incompatible expressions.

5.2 Entanglement

Nonlocal correlations arise from shared intrinsic structure not fully constrained by spacetime locality. No superluminal signaling is implied, and relativistic causality remains intact within regimes.

5.3 Relativity

Spacetime geometry describes synchronization and constraint relations within a regime. Relativity governs consistency of clocks and interactions, not necessarily the full substrate of existence.

5.4 Gravity

Gravity may be interpreted as a manifestation of regime-level synchronization constraints rather than a fundamental force acting on spacetime itself. This interpretation remains consistent with general relativity’s empirical success.

6. Cosmological Implications

Within this framework:

- Dark matter may correspond to entities whose dominant expressions do not couple electromagnetically in our regime but do couple gravitationally.

- Dark energy may reflect slow regime drift or large-scale changes in synchronization rather than a new substance or force.

- The Big Bang may be reinterpreted as a large-scale phase-locking or synchronization event rather than creation ex nihilo.

- Black holes may correspond to regions where certain expressions fail to re-synchronize, allowing transitions to other regimes without information destruction.

These interpretations do not alter empirical predictions, but reframe their conceptual basis.

7. Continuity as Emergent

A cautious extension of this framework considers the possibility that existence is fundamentally cyclic rather than continuous, with continuity emerging from dense, synchronized recurrence of intrinsic processes.

Under this view:

- Time emerges from recurrence.

- Persistence corresponds to stable reappearance.

- Identity is maintained through invariant intrinsic structure across cycles.

This reinterpretation remains compatible with existing measurements of time and does not modify relativistic or quantum dynamics.

8. Scope and Exclusions

This work deliberately restricts itself to physics.

- No claims are made regarding consciousness, cognition, or observer-dependent ontology.

- All references to observation are treated operationally, in the standard physical sense of interaction and measurement.

- No metaphysical claims regarding ultimate reality are asserted.

- No claim of mathematical completeness or predictive novelty is made.

The framework is interpretive, not revisionist.

9. Conclusion

The success of modern physics may reflect the internal completeness of a single regime of expression rather than exhaustion of all intrinsic characteristics of physical entities. A regime-based interpretation preserves existing laws while opening conceptual space to address persistent foundational problems without introducing new dynamical assumptions.

This work does not claim closure. Its value lies in proposing a structural distinction that may be formalized, tested, refined, or discarded under rigorous scrutiny.

Science advances not only through new equations, but through better distinctions.
This work offers one such distinction.

Appendix A: Frequently Asked Questions

Q1. Is this a new physical theory?

No. This is an interpretive framework. It does not replace or modify existing theories.

Q2. Does this violate known physical laws?

No. All established equations and conservation laws remain valid within their domains.

Q3. Is this the Many-Worlds interpretation?

No. Multiple regimes do not imply branching histories or duplication of states. Regimes are defined by non-coupling of dominant characteristics, not by quantum branching.

Q4. Is this a multiverse proposal?

Not in the conventional sense. The framework does not posit separate universes in space or time, but coexisting regimes of expression.

Q5. Is this metaphysics?

No. The framework is constrained by empirical compatibility and makes no claims beyond physics.

Q6. Is this falsifiable?

The framework suggests where regime-completeness may fail, motivating targeted analysis of anomalies and boundary conditions. Formal falsifiability depends on further mathematical and experimental development.
